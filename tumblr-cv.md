I'm a biologist who is passionate about finding ways to improve how we humans interact with our environment. I believe that ecological and human well-being are linked, and that economic success does not need to come at the exclusion of sustainable development.

I have worked on projects in areas as diverse as amphibian conservation, Ecosystem-based Management of forests, commercial invertebrate fisheries management, and carrion community ecology. I have experience conducting wildlife surveys for a variety of taxa (e.g. amphibians, macroinvertebrates, bats, waterfowl), PIT tagging, and taking water-quality measurements. I am well-accustomed to writing reports and academic articles, doing literature reviews, obtaining permits, supervising field teams, and analyzing data in R. Through these projects, I have also been fortunate to work with academics, government, and First Nations.

I completed my MSc at Simon Fraser University, where I was a member of [Earth to Ocean](http://www.sfu.ca/biology/earth2ocean/Earth2Ocean/Home.html), a research group that works on diverse freshwater and marine ecosystems. I studied how human disturbances, like climate change, impact amphibians and proposed a framework to help identify the risk of amphibian populations to decline. 

Currently, I am looking for new opportunities in environmental consulting. Contact me at sachaoregan “at” gmail.com.

## Education
### Simon Fraser University
**Master of Science**, 2010-13 <br />
Thesis title: Amphibians under stress: life histories, density dependence, and differences in vulnerability. [pdf](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32597037/SachaO%27Regan_MSc%20thesis.pdf)<br />Supervisor: Dr. Wendy Palen
### Western University
**B.Sc. Honors Biology with Distinction**, 2006-10<br />
Thesis title: Assessing the validity of quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (QNMR) spectroscopy as a technique for determining body composition of arthropods.<br />Supervisors: Dr. Graeme Taylor and Dr. Chris Guglielmo                                      

##Experience
###Independent Contractor
**Hakai Network for Coastal People, Ecosystems and Management**, British Columbia, June 2013 - 
I am conducting interviews with commercial sea cucumber, sea urchin, and geoduck fisherman to examine local-level trends in the fishery and to survey perceptions about the sustainability of the fisheries.
###Independent Contractor
**Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations**, British Columbia, March 2013<br />
I co-authored a report that (1) assesses how current forest management practices affect stream and forest functioning, and (2) makes recommendations as to how an experimental watersheds program can be conducted on the Central Coast to evaluate the implementation of ecosystem-based management (EBM). I synthesized the best available science on how forest harvesting and road construction practices affect aquatic habitat channel morphology, sediment supply, and function, as well as aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity.
###MSc Research
**Simon Fraser University**, Burnaby, British Columbia, 2010-13<br />
I outlined a framework for prioritizing amphibian decline risk based on relationships between life-history traits, density-dependent bottlenecks, and stressor occurrence. I conducted a large-scale outdoor study to investigate how three frog species (Great Basin spadefoot (*Spea intermontana*), Pacific chorus frog (*Pseudacris regilla*), and Northern red-legged frog (*Rana aurora*)) respond to climate warming and changes in pool permanency. 
Methods used: visual surveys for BC amphibian egg masses, PIT tagging and elastomer dye for mark-recapture, water temperature and dissolved oxygen measurements, *in vivo* and *in vitro* chlorophyll-a sampling, amphibian highway mortality surveys, literature reviews, data visualization and statistics in program R: linear and non-linear regression, mixed models, model simulations.
###NSERC USRA Researcher
**Simon Fraser University**, Burnaby, British Columbia, Summer 2010<br />
I conducted a literature review to characterize the state of knowledge on amphibian density-dependence. I assisted colleagues at the UBC Experimental Pond Facility with an study examining the impacts of warming and nutrient additions on food web structure and function.
###NSERC USRA Researcher
**University of Calgary**, Calgary, Alberta, Summer 2009<br />
I conducted a study examining the feeding preferences of two genera of dytiscid (predacious diving beetle) larvae. I assisted with (1) investigating the effects of early and late cattle grazing on temporary wetland ecology; and (2) analyzing the effects of predator (dragonfly larvae) abundance on dytiscid species that differ in anti-predator defenses. Through this, I gained a working knowledge of aquatic macroinvertebrate taxonomy.         
###Research Assistant
**Operation Wallacea**, SE Sulawesi, Indonesia, June, July 2008<br />
On Buton Island, I assisted with harp trapping and mist netting bats, radiotracking malay civets, conducting spectral tarsier habitat assessments, surveying crop-raiding behaviour of habituated Buton macaques, and swabbing frogs for fungal pathogens. At Hoga Island marine research facility, I assisted with coral reef monitoring (including laying transects for determination of coral rugosity, coral disease and impacts, and reef check for indicator fish and invertebrate species), sea mammal surveys, intertidal gastropod and bivalve transects, and identification of mangrove corals.
