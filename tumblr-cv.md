#Employment

##Environmental Scientist
Stantec Consulting Ltd., British Columbia, 2013-Present

I have been actively involved in all components of the environmental assessment process as well as Fisheries Act permitting for marine and freshwater components of oil and gas Projects. I am experienced in writing environmental assessments and technical data reports, permitting under the Fisheries Act, and I am proficient in data management, analysis, and visualization in R. My field experience includes pond-breeding amphibian, breeding bird, nocturnal raptor call-playback surveys, wildlife feature, intertidal, eelgrass, and subtidal ROV surveys in coastal BC habitats, and marine mammal surveys in both BC and the Saint Lawrence. 

##Independent Contractor
Hakai Network for Coastal People, Ecosystems and Management, British Columbia, June 2013

I conducted interviews with commercial sea cucumber, sea urchin, and geoduck fisherman to examine local-level trends in the fishery and to survey perceptions about the sustainability of the fisheries.

##Independent Contractor
Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations, British Columbia, March 2013

I co-authored a report that (1) assesses how current forest management practices affect stream and forest functioning, and (2) makes recommendations as to how an experimental watersheds program can be conducted on the Central Coast to evaluate the implementation of ecosystem-based management (EBM). I synthesized the best available science on how forest harvesting and road construction practices affect aquatic habitat channel morphology, sediment supply, and function, as well as aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity.

##MSc Research
Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, 2010-13

I outlined a framework for prioritizing amphibian decline risk based on relationships between life-history traits, density-dependent bottlenecks, and stressor occurrence. I conducted a large-scale outdoor study to investigate how three frog species (Great Basin spadefoot (*Spea intermontana*), Pacific chorus frog (*Pseudacris regilla*), and Northern red-legged frog (*Rana aurora*)) respond to climate warming and changes in pool permanency. 

Methods used: visual surveys for BC amphibian egg masses, PIT tagging and elastomer dye for mark-recapture, water temperature and dissolved oxygen measurements, *in vivo* and *in vitro* chlorophyll-a sampling, amphibian highway mortality surveys, literature reviews, data visualization and statistics in program R: linear and non-linear regression, mixed models, model simulations.

##NSERC USRA Researcher
Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Summer 2010

I conducted a literature review to characterize the state of knowledge on amphibian density-dependence. I assisted colleagues at the UBC Experimental Pond Facility with an study examining the impacts of warming and nutrient additions on food web structure and function.

##NSERC USRA Researcher
University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Summer 2009

I conducted a study examining the feeding preferences of two genera of dytiscid (predacious diving beetle) larvae. I assisted with (1) investigating the effects of early and late cattle grazing on temporary wetland ecology; and (2) analyzing the effects of predator (dragonfly larvae) abundance on dytiscid species that differ in anti-predator defenses. Through this, I gained a working knowledge of aquatic macroinvertebrate taxonomy.         

##Research Assistant
Operation Wallacea, SE Sulawesi, Indonesia, June, July 2008

On Buton Island, I assisted with harp trapping and mist netting bats, radiotracking malay civets, conducting spectral tarsier habitat assessments, surveying crop-raiding behaviour of habituated Buton macaques, and swabbing frogs for fungal pathogens. At Hoga Island marine research facility, I assisted with coral reef monitoring (including laying transects for determination of coral rugosity, coral disease and impacts, and reef check for indicator fish and invertebrate species), sea mammal surveys, intertidal gastropod and bivalve transects, and identification of mangrove corals.
